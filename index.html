          <img src="img/csharp.png" alt="csharp graphic" class="track-img-style">
          <h5 class="result-h5 m-3">Reasons to learn C#:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>C# is well-designed and well-implemented. From generics to asynchronous support, from LINQ to tuples, C# thoughtfully incorporates the latest thinking in programming languages without overloading the syntax with weird bits and clumsy hacks.</li>
            <li>C# is extremely productive and versatile for creating any type of application. From mobile apps running on Android and iOS, to web sites and services running in the cloud, C# is a tool that is dexterous enough to be used for a variety of projects.</li>
            <li>C# syntax is very like other C-type languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, Java, and JavaScript. Learn one and you are halfway to learning the others already.</li>

          <h5 class="result-h5 m-3">Reasons to learn React/CSS:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Used to produce web applications, native mobile apps, command line interfaces, avionics and much more.</li>
            <li>React is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks and cementing its leading position with its rapid growth.</li>
            <li>React/CSS is capable of building any complex UI keeping state out of the DOM. React employs a Virtual DOM that ensures maximum efficiency by only re-rendering nodes whenever it is required.</li>

          <h3>Java/Android</h3>
          <img src="img/java.png" alt="java graphic" class="track-img-style">
          <h5 class="result-h5 m-3">Reasons to learn Java/Android:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Object Oriented and easy-to-use, which means your code will have to be checked for errors before it can be built into an app. This means errors will be easier to track down. You will have less strange and unexpected errors, which means your codebase will be easier to maintain as it grows in size and complexity.</li>
            <li>Used for cross platform development.</li>
            <li>Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</li>
